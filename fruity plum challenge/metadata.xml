    <description>This is a joke mod based off of my [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2884230835]Little Beast Challenge[/url].

Start as a blindfolded Isaac riding A Pony. You'll get one Fruity Plum upgraded with Baby-Bender and Forgotten Lullaby. Travel through the Basement repeatedly until you face off against Baby Plum.

Starting items:
[list]
    [*]Fruity Plum (familiar)
    [*]Baby-Bender (smelted trinket / gives familiars homing shots)
    [*]Forgotten Lullaby (smelted trinket / gives familiars higher rate of fire)
    [*]A Pony (pocket slot / flight)
    [*]AAA Battery (trinket / lets A Pony recharge after each room)
[/list]

Items like the D4 shouldn't show up, but be careful. If you lose your Fruity Plum for any reason, that's a failure scenario. The whole point of this challenge is Baby Plum vs Fruity Plum.

You can play co-op if you want, but only the first player will get a Fruity Plum.
